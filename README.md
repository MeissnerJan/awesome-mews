## Books

- **Essential C#**
    - Very detailed book about all major features of C#. Highly recommended to everyone, who doesn't consider him to be an expert in C#. Feel free to just reach for a specific topic.
- **CLR via C#**
    - Even more detailed book not just about C# but mainly about the common language runtime. Recommended to everyone who is already familiar with C# essentials.
- **Functional programming in Scala**
    - You can ignore Scala, because this book is not about it. This book is about functional programming which we strongly prefer to use in our code. You don't have to just learn https://github.com/siroky/FuncSharp, you get to understand its concepts and many more by reading this book. This is a must read if you are not familiar with FP at all.
